## Contents
### 1. BionPres
Self explanatory
### 2. Elias xp
Self explanatory
### 3. images png
images used in the experiments; also stored in the opensesame files so not necessary
### 4. neurodesign scripts
The ITIs used come from the scripts with the _final suffix.
How to use:
- open Spyder
- set the working directory /Sequence and ITIs
- open the script in Spyder
- put the block number and a seed (for a reproductible random process)
- ctrl + enter (runs the content of the script)
- output would be a csv file named Phase-block-blocknumber.csv
### 5. pilotdata_and_ana
contains the csv log files from the pilots, the scripts for the analysis, and figures output\
The only subjects usable are 10, 15, 16, and 17
### 6. rebut
Not used files anymore
### 7. Sequence and ITIs
contains the output of neurodesign\
contains the **ISI script**:
- takes the output of neurodesign script and adds a column for ISIs, so that they are balanced within pairs and across runs
- how to use
  - open Spyder
  - set the working directory /Sequence and ITIs
  - open the script in Spyder
  - click on anywhere in a cell og interest (cells are delimited by #%%)
  - ctrl + enter (runs the content of the cell)
  - output would be a csv file named for Preconditioning phase PREOKALL.csv or PREOKALL2.csv; and for the conditioning phase CONOKblockXISI.csv
### 8. stims
contains the excell file used for the balancing of the stimuli
